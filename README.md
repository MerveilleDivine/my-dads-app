🛠️ AI Toolbox for Dad ❤️
This is a personal project I’m building for my father to help him keep up with the latest AI tools and make his life easier.
The app will serve as a simple, friendly AI toolbox gathering useful AI applications in one place so he can explore, learn, and use them without getting lost in the tech world.

Since my dad speaks French, the primary language of the app will be French 🇫🇷.

It’s a small gift of love, built with code.
